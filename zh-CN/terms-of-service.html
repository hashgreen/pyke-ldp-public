Consequently, you declare that you have attained the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., if you are in the United States, you should be at least 18 years old) and have the complete rights, authority, and power to agree to and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement on your own behalf as well as on behalf of any company or legal entity that may access or use the Interface. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you assure us that you possess the necessary legal authorization to bind said entity.</p><div class="h-5"></div><p class="text-[16px] leading-[26px]">Furthermore, you affirm that you do not fall under the following categories:</p><ol class="list-decimal pl-5"><li class="text-[16px] leading-[26px]">Being subject to economic or trade sanctions imposed by any governmental authority or listed as prohibited or restricted parties (including, but not limited to, the list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury).</li><li class="text-[16px] leading-[26px]">Being a citizen, resident, or entity organized in a jurisdiction or territory that is subject to comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions imposed by the United States.</li></ol><div class="h-5"></div><p class="text-[16px] leading-[26px]">Lastly, you guarantee that your access and utilization of any of our Products will fully adhere to all applicable laws and regulations. You commit to refraining from accessing or using any of our Products to engage in, promote, or facilitate any illegal activities.</p><div class="h-5"></div><p class="text-[16px] font-semibold leading-[24px]">NOTICE: This Agreement includes significant details that affect your rights regarding the resolution of disputes, including a binding arbitration provision and a waiver of class action.

Our Products</p><p class="text-[20px] font-medium">1.1 The Interface</p><p class="text-[16px] leading-[26px]">The Interface serves as a web or mobile-based platform that enables users to access the Hashgreen protocol, a decentralized protocol operating on various public blockchains, including but not limited to Chia. The Hashgreen protocol allows users to trade compatible digital assets. It&#x27;s important to note that the Interface and the Protocol are distinct entities, and the Interface is just one of the methods available for accessing the Protocol. The Protocol itself consists of self-executing smart contracts deployed on the Chia blockchain. Hashgreen Labs does not exercise control over or operate any versions of the Protocol on any blockchain network.</p><div class="h-5"></div><p class="text-[16px] leading-[26px]">When utilizing the Interface, it&#x27;s crucial to understand that you are not engaging in buying or selling digital assets from us, and we do not manage any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution. Fees paid by traders for trades are directed to liquidity providers within the Protocol. Generally, Hashgreen Labs is not a liquidity provider for Protocol liquidity pools, and liquidity providers are independent third parties. Initially, the Protocol was deployed on the Chia blockchain. Deployments on other networks typically involve cross-chain bridges, enabling the transfer of assets native to one blockchain to another. Please be aware that digital assets that have been &quot;bridged&quot; or &quot;wrapped&quot; to operate on other blockchain networks, including those compatible with the Chia Virtual Machine designed to enhance transaction processing capacity, are distinct from the original Chia mainnet asset.</p><div class="h-5"></div><p class="text-[16px] leading-[26px]">To access the Interface, you must utilize non-custodial wallet software that allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with the non-custodial wallet provider is governed by their respective terms of service. In the case of the Hashgreen Wallet, it is governed by this Agreement, while third-party wallets are subject to the terms of service provided by the third-party wallet provider. We do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet, and we cannot retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to our Interface, you agree to abide by this Agreement and all the terms incorporated herein by reference.</p><div class="h-5"></div><p class="text-[20px] font-medium">1.2 Other Products</p><p class="text-[16px] leading-[26px]">In the future, we may introduce additional products. Any such products will be considered as part of our offerings, referred to as a &quot;Product&quot; within the scope of this Agreement, regardless of whether they are explicitly defined in this Agreement.</p><div class="h-5"></div><p class="text-[20px] font-medium">1.3 Third Party Services and Content</p><p class="text-[16px] leading-[26px]">When utilizing any of our Products, it is possible that you may also be utilizing products, services, or content provided by third parties. Your usage of these third-party products, services, or content may be subject to separate policies, terms of use, and fees established by these third parties. By using such third-party offerings, you agree to comply with and take responsibility for their respective policies, terms of use, and applicable fees.</p><div class="h-10"></div><p class="mb-3 text-[24px]">2.

However, we do not develop these flags ourselves, and we strive to propagate them as soon as possible. We do not make any representations or warranties regarding the accuracy of these flags. Additionally, we may hide NFTs or collections, rendering them inaccessible on the NFT Marketplace Aggregator. Please note that the inability to view items or use the interface for the purchase, sale, or transfer of items on any blockchain does not serve as grounds for a claim against us.</li></ol><div class="h-5"></div><p class="text-[16px] font-semibold leading-[24px]">It is important to exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence when engaging in transactions involving NFTs.

Governing Law, Dispute Resolution and Class Action Waivers</p><p class="text-[20px] font-medium">8.1 Governing Law</p><p class="text-[16px] leading-[26px]">This clause specifies that the laws of the State of New York, without considering conflict of laws principles, govern the agreement and any disputes between you and us. It further states that our products are deemed to be based solely in the State of New York, regardless of their availability in other jurisdictions.

The arbitration will be confidential and conducted before a single arbitrator selected according to JAMS rules. The arbitrator&#x27;s decision, known as the award, may be entered as a judgment in any court with jurisdiction.</p><div class="h-5"></div><p class="text-[16px] leading-[26px]">However, in cases where arbitration is not applicable or permitted by law, you agree to waive the right to a jury trial and any claims must be brought in a Federal District Court or a New York state court located in New York County, New York.</p><div class="h-5"></div><p class="text-[16px] leading-[26px]">This clause outlines the process for resolving disputes and establishes the requirement for binding arbitration, with limited exceptions, if informal negotiations fail to reach a resolution.

This applies to both arbitration and court proceedings. It also states that both parties waive their right to a trial by jury, meaning that any legal proceedings will be decided by the arbitrator or the court without the involvement of a jury.</p><div class="h-10"></div><p class="mb-3 text-[24px]">9. Miscellaneous</p><p class="text-[20px] font-medium">9.1 Entire Agreement</p><p class="text-[16px] leading-[26px]">The terms herein represent the complete agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter at hand.

It is important for you to understand and acknowledge that we do not act as a broker for trading orders on your behalf.

Consequently, we cannot guarantee market best pricing or best execution through our Products or when utilizing our Auto Routing feature, which directs trades across liquidity pools on the Protocol exclusively. Any mentions of &quot;best price&quot; in relation to a Product should not be interpreted as a representation or warranty regarding pricing available through the Product, on the Protocol, or elsewhere.</p><div class="h-5"></div><p class="text-[20px] font-medium">9.5.

If modification or interpretation is not feasible, the invalidity or unenforceability of that provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement. The parties shall make good faith efforts to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision that reflects the original intent of the Agreement.</p></div></div><div class="ldp-container-root z-10 w-full bg-[#152A30] pt-10 pb-3"><div class="ldp-container flex flex-col items-center"><div class="grid w-fit grid-cols-2 gap-x-[88px] gap-y-8 md:w-full md:grid-cols-3"><div class="w-[130px] text-sm md:text-base"><p class="mb-4">footer-about</p><div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#B6B6B6] hover:text-[#C5F3FF] hover:no-underline" href="https://www.hashgreen.net/"><p class="text-inherit">footer-about_team</p></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#B6B6B6] hover:text-[#C5F3FF] hover:no-underline" href="https://docs.hash.green"><p class="text-inherit">footer-about_docs</p></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#B6B6B6] hover:text-[#C5F3FF] hover:no-underline" href="https://dex.hash.green"><p class="text-inherit">footer-about_dex</p></a></div></div><div class="w-[130px] text-sm md:text-base"><p class="mb-4">footer-contact</p><div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#B6B6B6] hover:text-[#C5F3FF] hover:no-underline" href="mailto:contact@hashgreen.net"><p class="text-inherit">footer-contact_us</p></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#B6B6B6] hover:text-[#C5F3FF] hover:no-underline" href="https://www.cakeresume.com/companies/hashgreen"><p class="text-inherit">footer-contact_careers</p></a></div></div><div class="w-[130px] text-sm md:text-base"><p class="mb-4">footer-community</p><div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#B6B6B6] hover:text-[#C5F3FF] hover:no-underline" href="https://discord.gg/KXvqv6cwAk"><p class="text-inherit">footer-community_discord</p></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#B6B6B6] hover:text-[#C5F3FF] hover:no-underline" href="https://twitter.com/hashgreenlabs"><p class="text-inherit">footer-community_twitter</p></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#B6B6B6] hover:text-[#C5F3FF] hover:no-underline" href="https://hashgreen.medium.com/"><p class="text-inherit">footer-community_medium</p></a></div></div></div><div class="mt-10 mb-3 w-full xl:mb-4"><div class="mb-2 w-full border border-[#2A525E]"></div><div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row md:justify-between"><div class="flex flex-1 gap-3 text-xs text-white"><a href="/zh-CN/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a><a href="/zh-CN/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a></div><p class="text-xs text-[#B6B6B6]">Copyright © 2023 Hashgreen Inc.
